Using the ``lumi`` Command
==========================

.. highlight:: shell

The ``lumi`` command is a tool that helps compile, test, and run Lumi code.
For example, ``lumi`` command can be :ref:`used <lumi-command-usage>` to build
an executable directly from Lumi code by simply running ``lumi hello.4.lm``.

The ``lumi`` command:

* assumes the used Lumi compilers are already :ref:`built <build-compiler>` and
  are in the system path

* assumes :ref:`lumipath` is correctly configured

* uses the ``CC`` environment variable to determine the C compiler command,
  using ``gcc`` if not exists

* supports all Lumi version from TL0 to :ref:`TL5 <syntax-tl5>`

.. _lumipath:

LUMIPATH
--------
For C linking purposes ``lumi`` command needs to know the local `Lumi
repository`_ root directory path. This can be configured by one of:

1. running ``lumi`` command inside the `Lumi repository`_ root directory
2. setting the value of ``LUMIPATH`` environment variable to the path
3. running ``lumi`` with flag ``-p <path>`` (this will override ``LUMIPATH``
   environment variable)

Path Separator
++++++++++++++
The default path separator in ``lumi`` command is ``/``. In systems where the
path separator is ``\`` instead (such as Windows), the :ref:`lumipath` must end
with a ``\`` character. Doing this will set the path separator in ``lumi``
command to ``\``.

Command Help
------------
Running ``lumi -h`` will print help

.. code-block:: none

   >>> lumi -h
   Usage: lumi [options] file...
   Options:
     -h             print help
     -o <file>      output file name
     -t <module>    compile test program for <module>
     -c             only create C file(s)
     -l<version>    only run C compiler for TL<version>
     -e <file>      external C file for C compilation
     -p <lumipath>  path of lumi-lang repository
     -r               run the compiled program
     -ra <arguments>  run the compiled program with given arguments
     -v             print executed commands
     -d             only print commands without execution

.. _lumi-command-usage:

Usage
-----
The basic usage of ``lumi`` command is to take one or more Lumi files and
create a single executable from them. For example::

   lumi hello.4.lm

will create a ``hello`` named executable compiled from ``hello.4.lm``,
generating a ``hello.c`` C file in the process. This is done by running Lumi
compiler and C compiler one after another.

If multiple Lumi files are given, the generated name will be based on the first
input file.

``lumi`` command detects the TL version based on the input file extension
``.[TL version].lm`` and runs the respective Lumi compiler.

Specifying an Explicit Output File Name
---------------------------------------
The output file name can be explicitly defined with ``-o <output file name>``.
For example::

   lumi hello.4.lm -o output

will generate ``output`` named executable, and ``output.c`` named C file in the
process.

Compiling Tests
---------------
Lumi compiler allows generating :ref:`testing <testing>` code for a specific
Lumi module. This feature can be used in ``lumi`` command with ``-t <tested
module name>``. For example::

   lumi -t hello hello-tests.4.lm hello.4.lm

will generate ``hello-tests`` executable that tests the ``hello`` module.

Running a Lumi test executable with ``-xml`` argument will also generate a
``cobertura.xml`` named file with code coverage XML report in `cobertura`_
scheme.

Only Running Lumi Compiler
--------------------------
To only run the Lumi compiler ``-c`` flag can be used. For example::

   lumi -c hello.4.lm

will only generate ``hello.c`` C file.

Only Running C Compiler
-----------------------
To only run the C compiler ``-l<TL version>`` flag can be used. The TL version
number must be given as it cannot be detected from the input C file name. For
example::

   lumi -l4 hello.c

will only generate ``hello`` executable, assuming ``hello.c`` was generated by
TL4.

External C Files
----------------
To include external C file in the C compilation ``-e`` can be used. For
example::

   lumi hello.4.lm -e external.c

will add ``external.c`` as an input to the C compiler, while ignoring it in the
Lumi compilation. This is mainly needed when :ref:`external C code is called
from Lumi <native>`.

Running the Generated Executable
--------------------------------
The generated executable can also be run using ``-r``. For example::

   lumi -r hello.4.lm

will generate ``hello`` executable and then run it.

It possible to also send arguments to the executable using ``-ra <arguments>``.
For example::

   lumi -r hello.4.lm -ra 'first-arg "second arg"'

Will run ``hello first-arg "second arg"``.

Verbose and Debug
-----------------
Adding ``-v`` (verbose) option will also print the executed commands.

Adding ``-d`` (debug) option will only print the commands without execution.

Old Version Limitations
-----------------------
* multiple input Lumi files are not supported in TL0 and TL1
* implicit output name is determined by the last file in TL2, and not the first
* TL2 and TL3 generate multiple C files - one C file for each input Lumi file,
  this also meas that an explicit output name for C files is not supported
* testing is only supported in TL4
