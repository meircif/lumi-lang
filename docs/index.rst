Lumi Language Guide
===================

Welcome to **Lumi** programming language guide!

Lumi is a general purpose programming language that is good for all needs,
specially for long-term projects, or where resource efficiency is needed.

Lumi aims to be safe, efficient, flexible, easy to write,
and easy to maintain. See :ref:`goals` for more details.

Lumi files use ``.lm`` extension.

"Lumi" name was chosen because:

* "Lumi" is an abbreviation for "Illuminating", and Lumi language aims to cast
  new light to the programming world. (it's also the meaning of my first name)
* "Lumi" means "snow" in Finnish, which is bright, light, handy, flexible,
  strong and fun - such as the Lumi language. (and also - I like snow)
* "Lumi" is short, easy to pronounce, and fun to say.

A Work in Progress...
---------------------
Lumi is still under initial planning and building. Many features are already
implemented and it is possible to write complex programs with Lumi, but some
key elements are not, and many implemented feature may change dramatically.

The latest state of the language is named ":ref:`Temporary Lumi 5
<syntax-tl5>`", or "TL5" in short, to emphasizing the current temporary state
of the language.
